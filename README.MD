A few exercises from a subject named Operating Systems

1. Memory management, libraries, time measuring    
Create a library to manage an address book, on a list and on a tree.  
Create a program which uses library.  
Compare times (static libraries, shared, dynamic).  
Make a program with a bug and generate core file (segmentation fault).  

2. Files  
Make a program which compares system and library functions for input/output.  
Generate n records of given size (use /dev/random) and measure time of bubble sort and shuffle.  
Make a program which can walk directory tree to find files which size is smaller or equal than given.  
Lock files  

3. Processes  
Make simple interpreter. Read file lines with environment variables to set (e.g. #A 30), or command for execution.  
Make a program which sets limits for virtual memory and CPU time.
